# Text Captcha jQuery plugin

This came about because I was building a website and one of the goals was to have no images on the entire site. I didn't want to use something like recaptcha for human testing. It allows for both alphabetic and mathematic testing. There is also a method for simple [jQuery Validate](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) integration

## What's new in v. 0.4?
- **Added target option. Now the captcha fields can be added anywhere in your forms. See examples > target.html for example**

## Text testing
For text testing, it gives a random string of letters and asks the user to sort them by alphabetic order, reverse alphabetic order or backwards from the way they are displayed

## Math testing
For math testing, it provides 2 random numbers between 0 and 9. You can either choose the type of math to perform (addition, subtraction or multiplication) or you can choose random.

## Number testing
For number testing, it gives a random listing of numbers and asks the user to sort them by numeric or reverse numeric order.


## Usage
Using textCaptcha is as easy as typing

	$('formElement').textCaptcha();

or as complicated as

	$('formElement').textCaptcha({
		type: 'text',
		method: 'backwards',
		length: 6
	});

## Options

### Types
**text** *Texutal functions*

**math** *Math functions*

**number** *Number functions*

**random** *Self explanitory*

# Text Captcha Check

I've created a method that returns true/false if the value is correct and have written a custom [jQuery Validate](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) method to simplify form validation. However, if you prefer to write your own validation, this method returns true/false, so it will be easy to tie in to your own validation functionality.

## Usage

Using this with jQuery validate is quite simple. Just add the method below and check the value in your validate rules.

	$.validator.addMethod("captchaCheck",
		function() {
			return $('formElement').textCaptchaCheck();
		},
		"Captcha value does not match");

Then add it to your **jQuery Validate** rules like this:

	$("formElement").validate({
		rules: {
			captcha_user: {
				required: true,
				captchaCheck: true
			}
		}
	});

Please note that captcha_user is the input name for the user submitted captcha value. We added the captchaCheck rule for captcha_user to implement our custom Validator method.

## Notes
- Put text-captcha call before validation to remove possibility of order of operation issues.
